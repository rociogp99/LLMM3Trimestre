7. How XML should look is described in the XML 1.0 W3C Recommendation. 
   The language of the standard is somewhat technical and formal,
   but being able to read the standard yourself is quite useful.
   Look into the standard and answer the following questions:

 a. What do comments look like in XML? (section 2.5)

	Comments may appear anywhere in a document outside other markup; 
	in addition, they may appear within the document type declaration at places allowed by the grammar.
	They are not part of the document's character data; an XML processor may, but need not,
	make it possible for an application to retrieve the text of comments. 

 b. Can an attribute be repeated in the same element? (section 3.1)

	An attribute name must not appear more than once in the same start-tag or empty-element tag.

 c. Where is it stated that the element names in opening and closing tags must match?

	The declaration matches children and the sequence of child elements belongs to the language generated
	by the regular expression in the content model, with optional white space, comments and PIs 
	(i.e. markup matching production [27] Misc) between the start-tag and the first child element, between child elements,
	or between the last child element and the end-tag.
